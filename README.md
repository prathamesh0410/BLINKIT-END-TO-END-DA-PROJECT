# BLINKIT-END-TO-END-DA-PROJECT
🛒 Blinkit Sales Dashboard – SQL + Power BI Project This project is a complete end-to-end analysis of Blinkit's sales data. I used SQL to clean and prepare the data, and then built an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover useful business insights.

🎯 Project Goal
The main idea behind this project was to help Blinkit better understand:

1)How much they're selling (total sales)

2)What’s the average revenue per sale

3)Which products are selling the most

4)How satisfied customers are (based on ratings)

5)This kind of analysis can help improve business decisions, marketing strategies, and product placement.
